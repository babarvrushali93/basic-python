        "-  Boolean Operators are simple words (AND, OR, NOT or AND NOT) used as conjunctions to combine or exclude keywords in a search, resulting in more focused and productive results.\n",

        "1.AND operator: The AND operator is used to combine two or more conditions in a Boolean expression. It returns true if all the conditions are true, and false otherwise. In programming, the AND operator is often represented by the symbol \"&&\". For example, in the expression \"A && B\", both A and B must be true for the overall expression to be true.\n",

It returns true if at least one of the conditions is true, and false if all the conditions are false. In programming, the OR operator is often represented by the symbol \"||\". For example, in the expression \"A || B\", the expression is true if either A or B (or both) are true.\n",

        "3.NOT operator: The NOT operator, also known as the negation operator, is used to reverse the logical state of a condition. It returns true if the condition is false, and false if the condition is true. In programming, the NOT operator is often represented by the symbol \"!\". For example, in the expression \"!A\", if A is true, then \"!A\" is false, and vice versa.\n",
